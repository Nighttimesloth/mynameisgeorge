# Building standalone executable

## Run `PySilon.bat` and GUI will appear. Fill the needed information and click on `Generate source`, then `Compile`

Inside builder, you can `Load configuration` to save time between testing or you can `Load custom...` configuration from desired configuration-file, additionally, you can `Reset` the settings or `Save` them for later. When you `Generate source`, configuration will be automatically saved.  
If you (for some reason) cannot use GUI, you [must use the obsolete way](https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware/wiki/Preperation#manual-way-obsolete) or wait for me to publish the CLI update of builder
  
## Multiple Discord BOT tokens

**You can add more than one BOT-token to malware in case of the first one getting banned by Discord (```Emergency token 1/2```). If first token gets banned, PySilon will automatically run with another one (if you set them in compiler.py)**

If you encounter any errors, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware/issues/new/choose) and I'll be happy to help as soon as possible.

**Now, everything is ready for a showtime**
